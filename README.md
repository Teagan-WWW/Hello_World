# Hello_World
## Description
This is a **practice repository** to learn github functions. I'll be using this to practice <ins>different syntax options</ins>, <ins>branching</ins>, <ins>merging</ins>, and <ins>organizing the README file</ins>.
## Task List:
- [x] Create a new repository

### Branching and Merging
This is a practice of the **branch function**. The line was added as a new branch, a pull request was opened, and it was merged into the main branch.
